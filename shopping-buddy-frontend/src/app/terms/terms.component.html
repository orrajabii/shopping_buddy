<h2>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COMPLAINTS</h2>
<p>
ShoppingBuddy.ca respects the intellectual property of others. If you believe that your intellectual property rights are being infringed, please follow our Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.</p><br>
<h2>RISK OF LOSS</h2>
<p>
Risk of loss and title for items purchased from ShoppingBuddy.ca pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier or, if such items must cross an international border, then risk of loss and title pass to you when they clear customs in Canada.</p><br>
<h2>RETURNS, REFUNDS AND TITLE</h2>
<p>
ShoppingBuddy.ca does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our fulfillment centre. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, ShoppingBuddy.ca does not take title to the refunded item. If we receive items that do not meet the requirements of our return policies, including items returned past the eligible return window, opened items or damaged items, we may charge a restocking fee or issue a partial refund. Details about the restocking fees and partial refunds can be found on our Refunds help page. For more information about our returns and refunds in general, please see our Online Returns Centre.</p><br>
<h2>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS</h2>
<p>
ShoppingBuddy.ca attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, ShoppingBuddy.ca does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any ShoppingBuddy.ca Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by ShoppingBuddy.ca itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.</p><br>
<h2>PRICING</h2>
<p>
"List Price" means the suggested retail price of a product as provided by a manufacturer, supplier, or seller. We regularly check List Prices against prices recently found on ShoppingBuddy.ca and other retailers. Certain products may have a "Was Price" displayed, which is determined using recent price history of the product on ShoppingBuddy.ca.

With respect to items sold by ShoppingBuddy.ca, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you offer to purchase the item by placing an order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalogue may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by ShoppingBuddy.ca is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other merchants may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.

We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process or, for digital products, until we make the digital product available to you.</p><br>
<h2>APP PERMISSIONS</h2>
<p>
When you use apps created by ShoppingBuddy.ca, such as the ShoppingBuddy App or Kindle App, you may grant certain permissions to us for your device. Most mobile devices provide you with information about these permissions.</p><br>
<h2>SANCTIONS AND EXPORT POLICY</h2>
<p>
You may not use any ShoppingBuddy.ca Service if you are the subject of U.S. sanctions or of sanctions consistent with U.S. law imposed by the governments of the country where you are using ShoppingBuddy.ca Services. You must comply with all U.S. or other export and re-export restrictions that may apply to goods, software (including ShoppingBuddy Software), technology, and services.</p><br>

<h2>DISPUTES</h2>
<p>
(Not applicable to Quebec consumers) Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any ShoppingBuddy.ca Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by ShoppingBuddy.ca or through ShoppingBuddy.ca Services will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and U.S. federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totalling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, ShoppingBuddy.ca will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.

We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p><br>
<h2>APPLICABLE LAW</h2>
<p>
(Not applicable to Quebec consumers) By using any ShoppingBuddy.ca Service, you agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, applicable U.S. federal law, and the laws of the state of Washington, United States, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and ShoppingBuddy.ca.

For Quebec consumers: These Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and ShoppingBuddy.ca shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Quebec, without reference to its conflict of laws provisions, and the laws of Canada applicable therein, and any disputes will be submitted to the courts of competent jurisdiction of the District of Montreal (Quebec).

Please review our other policies, such as our pricing policy, posted on the ShoppingBuddy.ca site. These policies also govern your use of ShoppingBuddy.ca Services. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, Service Terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p><br>
